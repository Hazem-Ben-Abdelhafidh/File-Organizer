# File Organizer

This Go program organizes files within my "Downloads" directory by moving them into categorized subdirectories based on their file types (e.g., images, videos, PDFs). The program scans through files in the directory and sorts them into folders such as `Images`, `Videos`, `PDF`, `Excels`, `Docs`, and `Others`.

## Features

- Moves image files (JPEG, PNG, etc.) to an `Images` folder.
- Moves video files (MP4, MKV, etc.) to a `Videos` folder.
- Moves PDF files to a `PDF` folder.
- Moves Excel files (XLSX, CSV) to an `Excels` folder.
- Moves text-based files (TXT, ODT, DOC) to a `Docs` folder.
- Moves all other files to an `Others` folder.
